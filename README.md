A social app for friends 

## General Information
As a user I want to have an app for my friends and I to find each other. I want to be able to exchange thoughts, and to react to those thoughts.

## Installation
First the user needs to install npm packages, which should come with express, and mongodb. The user needs to make sure to use mongodb to get the db set and run the seeds.

## Usage
The user must make sure to run mongodb to get the db and tables. Once this is done the user needs to run the seeds and get the server up and listening. From here the user can add friends, or remove them. After you have friends, you can post a thought or delete one. If you have a thought your friend's can react to it.
